PyTorch:
- optimized tensor library
- main data structure used are tensors (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/tensorqs_tutorial.html)
- most functions optimized for tensors or only usable for tensors
- tensors can be used and are optimized for usage on CPU and GPU
- tensor datatypes: floating-point, complex, interger and boolean 
- these functions can transform, modify, extract data stored in tensors
- has own benchmark functions for measuring performance
- iree-turbine provides integration of IREE for PyTorch
